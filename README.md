humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only
Cat Years

15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that

## Keep up the hoop, second program

Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".
FUNDAMENTALS


## generate range of integers, third program


Description:

Implement a function named generateRange(min, max, step), which takes three arguments and generates a range of integers from min to max, with the step. The first integer is the minimum value, the second is the maximum of the range and the third is the step. (min < max)

Task

Implement a function named

generateRange(2, 10, 2) // should return array of [2,4,6,8,10]
generateRange(1, 10, 3) // should return array of [1,4,7,10]
Note

min < max
step > 0
the range does not HAVE to include max (depending on the step)
ALGORITHMS

## no zeros for heros, forth program


Numbers ending with zeros are boring.

They might be fun in your world, but not here.

Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.

1450 -> 145
960000 -> 96
1050 -> 105
-1050 -> -105
Zero alone is fine, don't worry about it. Poor guy anyway
