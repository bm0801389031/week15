Kata Task

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

NOTES:

humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only
Cat Years

15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years

15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that


## Keep up the hoop, second program

Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".
